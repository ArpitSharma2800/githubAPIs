"hemantupadhyay24/Geofencing-with-Task-Management","Geofencing with Task Management is an integrated intranet system, developed for use by the faculty personnel within college, universities or offices, adapted to Smartphone's, tablets and handheld devices with the campus or university under the same LAN. Most of the colleges in India do traditional manual paperwork to maintain the records of teacher’s attendance & schedule which become burdensome. Though it works efficiently most of the time but compromises time and space. The proposed system which is based on an Android platform facilitates principal, HOD and the personnel's faculty staff throughout with the facility, regardless of the existence of network connection in the area using a typical smartphone. The proposed application and its backend system maintains access to teachers location based on Real-Time Location System (RTLS), called geofencing as well as maintaining & manipulating their timetable, checking out today’s schedule of a teacher. Additional features include editing the timetable for minor changes or import excel sheet for major changes.

"18601949127/DiDiCallCar","这是我自己做的一个类似滴滴打车的Android出行项目，主要针对滴滴等出行平台一直饱受质疑的“人车不符”问题，以及当前越发火热的或计划和出海战略，给出行项目增加了下面几个功能：  1. RFID识别验证功能：在司机证件或者车内识别硬件嵌入RFID识别芯片，乘客使用手机读取到芯片信息，并且通过网络发送到出行平台数据库进行验证（我用JNI加了一个C语言的MD5加密算法对识别到的信息进行了加密）。如果不是合规的“人”或“车”，则不能完成订单并向平台或监管单位汇报当前位置。（为了方便读者测试，可以使用手机读取任何一个加密或非加密RFID芯片，比如银行卡、公交卡等，我在代码中的验证前阶段把芯片信息都换成我自己的司机信息，确保读者测试时可以收到服务器的回复） 2. 海外版功能：点击切换当前语言。 3. 司机证件号码识别功能：读取司机证件上的证件号码，也可以用来与出行平台数据库的接单司机信息进行。I complete this whole project on my own . Including Android application programming，web server ( Apache + PHP + MySQL),  and UI.  1．Map route planing。You can use mobile phone choose pick up & destination address，application provide address name hint and draw optimized route for user , then call car for you. 2．RFID authentication function：User can use application to scan driver license or other RFID hardware, then use NDK MD5 algorithm encrypt RFID number, and send it to Web Server Database, check with driver information and authenticate ID number , if ID number coherent with driver info , send back driver information to User and continue call car order . record user location  and alert if ID not coherent. 3．Driver License Number Recognition : Application can recognize driver license digit number ,and also can send to web server for authentication & feed back result to user.

Also, it creates a medical profile for each user where you can add all your history, and automatically, the application creates a special QR code for you ""Patient"" that you can scan it to get all data about you. another service in our application was ""Blood bank"" in which you donate/request blood from people near you, offering payment or no. which will make it easier to request and donate blood ! another important service was the ""Ambulance"" in which you click the emergency button and the application calls and sends your Coordinates to the ambulance for Urgent actions. (the government shall support an API for that). one thing else, is that we've created a service for the governmental alerts with notifications for the users.

We extract some information about the application and add it to the windows event log of the server containing the network.

"LarryBrinzo/eElection","Since the adoption of the Indian Constitution in 1950, 17 general elections and many elections of various State Legislative Assemblies have been held. Although these elections were generally free and fair, yet some weaknesses of our election system have been noticed. In India, elections are very expensive and a common man, however, intelligent and honest he may be, cannot fight elections. In India, a large number of votes are cast on the basis of caste and religion. As a result, people get divided on the basis of caste, religion and community which is very harmful to national unity. Some candidates also capture the polling booths and make use of their muscle powers to do it. In India, many voters do not cast their votes. The voting percentage generally is almost 50 to 60 percent. In India, it takes a long time in the disposal of election petitions and sometimes the very purpose of election petition gets defeated.  Taking into account these flaws in the Indian election system, our team came up with an idea of building an Android Application platform to minimise these flaws using Blockchain and Android Software Development Kit. We are building this application with an aim that one-day Indian elections would solely be conducted on this application. There would no polling booths, no election rallies and no election campaigning on roads. We hope that our idea will shape a discrimination-free, an inexpensive, steady and secure elections.  The salient features of this application would be:  Parties can easily and securely broadcast their election posters and videos into the application. Parties can also conduct live public meetings with the complete involvement of the electors through a chat system. Parties can have access to all questions asked by the voters any time and can post the solution publicly. Parties will have to broadcast their manifesto into the application and will also have to submit one to Election Commission of India.  There will be real-time monitoring over shared content to bring about a check over the caste-based campaigning.  The electors will be authenticated through their Voter ID or Aadhar card. The voters can also authenticate using their unique fingerprint.  There would be an easy and secure way of casting a vote through the application using Blockchain. The voter’s information will be stored in a Block so that they are not easily tampered by the attackers.  Using Blockchain, we promise a steady and secure election system. The election results could be calculated steadily and securely.  In a place where there is no internet, the application can build a local blockchain, storing data in the phone memory and can be later merged to the global blockchain. (Again at such places election will be conducted under supervised authority)  Once the elections are over, citizens can have a timely update of what the ruling party is up to, and what are the reforms made by them till now. Citizens can easily direct a suggestion or complaint to the ruling party.","[""android"",""memory"",""get"",""post"",""time"",""broadcast"",""build"",""shared"",""block"",""local"",""this"",""casting"",""monitoring"",""chat"",""real-time"",""state"",""global"",""promise"",""system"",""platform"",""account"",""submit"",""capture"",""percentage"",""android-application"",""to-do"",""update"",""blockchain"",""application"",""common"",""phone"",""videos"",""information"",""free"",""cast"",""shape"",""data"",""community"",""content"",""secure"",""live"",""check"",""development"",""number"",""place"",""elections"",""timely"",""so"",""results"",""easy"",""about"",""can"",""it"",""polling"",""voting"",""idea"",""with"",""in"",""software"",""places"",""party"",""features"",""team"",""public"",""authenticate"",""complete"",""aadhar"",""building"",""fight"",""the"",""as"",""election"",""vote"",""long"",""access"",""software-development"",""make"",""indian"",""questions"",""to"",""one"",""direct"",""no"",""on"",""using"",""a"",""not"",""solution"",""large"",""cannot"",""religion"",""and"",""made"",""an"",""some"",""intelligent"",""meetings"",""adoption"",""aim"",""will"",""do"",""once"",""suggestion"",""id"",""any"",""easily"",""over""]"

"TheSoumyajitDey/Electricity-Management-System-in-Android-","The project is an Android based application where users can get instant electricity bill and pay them online via credit card. The system automates the conventional process of paying electricity bill by visiting the place. Users have to stand in queue for paying bill and wait for their turn. The process is tiresome and time consuming. They even have to wait for the bill being delivered to their place which sometimes can be delivered late by the delivery boy. Hence the system is developed to automate the electricity bill calculation and payment for user convenience. The system would be having two logins admin and user login. Admin can view user account details and can even add or updates things in their account. Admin has to feed the system with electricity usage data into respective users account through online web application. The system then calculates the electricity bill for every user and updates the information into their account every month. User can then view their electricity bill and pay on the spot before month end. If user is incapable of paying the bill before month end, it then calculates fine for each day.","[""android"",""get"",""view"",""web"",""time"",""process"",""project"",""updates"",""queue"",""payment"",""wait"",""system"",""add"",""account"",""feed"",""application"",""delivery"",""information"",""data"",""details"",""month"",""place"",""calculation"",""for"",""can"",""it"",""with"",""in"",""online"",""user"",""admin"",""credit"",""the"",""based"",""usage"",""to"",""instant"",""pay"",""spot"",""on"",""bill"",""users"",""and"",""an"",""things"",""two"",""then"",""electricity""]"
