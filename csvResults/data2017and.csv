"shriharsha-b/AndroidBash-FirebaseAdmob","Admob is the #1 mobile advertising platform to grow your app business and is powered by Google’s ad technology. You can integrate AdMob in your android application and start earning right away. The best way to use AdMob is with Firebase, though Google Mobile Ads SDK remains available as a standalone SDK which can also be used to integrate Admob with your android application. Admob publishers can start taking advantage of Firebase's free and unlimited analytics solution to monetize more intelligently, just by linking with Firebase and importing the Firebase SDK into your android application. In this tutorial we will be showing how to integrate Admob with your android application using Firebase.  <p>Now let us create an android application on which we can integrate Firebase Admob to display Banner ads, Interstitial ads and Native Ads.</p> 1. We will display a <strong>Banner ad</strong> at the bottom of the activity. 2. We will display an <strong>Interstitial ad</strong> covering the whole screen, once the user clicks on an item in the list of movies. 3. We will display <strong>Native ads</strong> in between the list of movies displayed in a RecyclerView. The steps will be described in five detailed yet simple parts.","[""sdk"",""android"",""admob"",""firebase"",""mobile"",""native"",""ads"",""banner"",""list"",""display"",""interstitial"",""this"",""analytics"",""platform"",""firebase-admob"",""google"",""advertising"",""android-application"",""app"",""simple"",""application"",""tutorial"",""free"",""movies"",""ad"",""standalone"",""business"",""firebase-sdk"",""linking"",""can"",""bottom"",""best"",""with"",""in"",""item"",""user"",""steps"",""interstitial-ads"",""the"",""as"",""to"",""monetize"",""ads-sdk"",""on"",""using"",""a"",""how"",""solution"",""how-to"",""create"",""and"",""an"",""will"",""start"",""once"",""mobile-ads""]"

"jinyanliu/PopularMovies","Present users with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch. Allow users to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated (movie data fetched from the Internet with the MovieDB API) or by favorite movies (movie data fetched from the local database). Allow users to choose enabling offline use or not via a setting: When enabling offline use is checked, movie posters and movies' basic information will be saved to users' local app cache folder for future offline usage, and will be automatically updated approximately every 24 hours. Created three tables (Movie, Trailer, Review) in one local database. Implemented Content Provider to access the database to fetch favorite movies data. Allow users to tap on a movie poster and transition to a detail screen with additional information such as: original title / movie poster image thumbnail / a plot synopsis / user rating / release date / trailers / reviews. Allow users to view and play trailers via an Intent either to launch in Youtube app or a web browser (if Youtube app isn't installed on the user's phone). Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping the star floating action button. Allow users to delete a movie from the favorite movie database by tapping the star button again. Color grey on the star indicates the movie is not stored in the database. To display the details requires an API request. Color yellow on the star indicates the movie is stored in the database (including trailers and reviews). To display the details does not require an API request. Implemented sharing functionality to allow the user to share the first trailer's Youtube URL from the movie details screen. Allow users to interact with the app via a widget: When click the widget title, the app main screen opens directly. When click one of the widget movies' list, the clicked movie detail screen opens directly. Implemented deep links, so that when users go back from one movie's detail screen, it will come back to the app's main screen instead of jumping out of the app directly. Allow users to get a highest-rated popular movie notification every day. Incorporated libraries to simplify the amount of code, such as: Using Picasso to fetch images and load them into views. Using RecyclerView and ConstraintLayouts to implement efficient layout design. Used adapters and viewholders to populate list views. Used databinding to populate details views.

"rpadma/Rappay","My entry for ICICI Bank Hackathon 2016- Proposed a mobile app with the following functionality     1)      A bank account is at the crux of a user’s relationship with the bank. However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user’s favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

One of the reason for doing so is because there are times where one might carry sensitive information on their Android devices.  Also, you might want to hide some data from a friend or acquaintance.  Results from this experiment was of a custom rom. The custom rom allowed users to hide data easily by using an insignificant button that most users do not use. When we toggle, what really happens  in the background (the backend) is that there are 2 sets of data; one showing and the other hiding.  When a toggle is set, the data swaps and the hidden set is being encrypted, vice versa. Since the phone is locked, when an adversary would want to perform forensics to retrieve data,  the data would be erased as unlocking requires wiping of the phone storage memory.","[""android"",""background"",""button"",""storage"",""toggle"",""set"",""this"",""rom"",""custom-rom"",""reason"",""custom"",""phone"",""information"",""data"",""forensics"",""development"",""experiment"",""hidden"",""so"",""results"",""times"",""for"",""hide"",""in"",""2"",""try"",""from"",""phone-storage"",""the"",""as"",""sensitive"",""to"",""one"",""on"",""using"",""retrieve"",""a"",""not"",""users"",""and"",""friend"",""an"",""some"",""do"",""other"",""easily""]"

"MengchuanFu/Suspecious-Apps-Detection","With the rapid adoption of smartphones, tablets, and mobile apps, they are increasingly becoming part of children’s daily life for amusement and education. According to MarketingProfs, 75% of American children under 8 have access to a smartphone or tablet [1]. According to a survey conducted by PBS KIDS [2] 90% parents with kids between the ages of 2 and 10 state that they believe that educational apps will play an important role in children’s learning in the future. Among smartphone and tablet operating systems, Android and Apple’s iOS dominate the U.S. smartphone market by 53.2 and 41.3 percent, respectively [3]. The growth rate of Apps added to both platform accelerates every year. In 2012, there were a total of 567,322 apps on Google Play platform [4], 723,750 apps on iOS App store [5]. By 2014, the number of apps has doubled, with 1.43 million Apps on Google Play and 1.21 million Apps on iOS [6]. How do parents choose appropriate apps for their kids? PBS’s survey [2] showed that when selecting games and apps for their children, 56% of parents base their decisions on age recommendations. Such decision strategy is far from perfect. There is a rising concern among parents who have experienced unreliable content maturity ratings for mobile apps that result in inappropriate risk exposure for children. In order to help parents determine age-appropriate mobile apps for their children, both Android and iOS apps come with maturity ratings that are similar to the movie and video game industry. Such maturity ratings examine the existence and intensity of mature themes such as mature content, violence, offensive language, sexual content, and drug usage within each app. However, movie and video game industries have official rating organizations such as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which set standards for film rating systems – mobile apps do not. Instead of having standard rating rules across platforms, each mobile platform establishes or adopts its own rating policy and rating strategy. iOS’s policy provides four different maturity-rating levels based on the suitable age of audience: “4+,” “9+,” “12+,” and “17+.” In the past, Android rating contained four maturityrating levels: “Everyone,” “Low Maturity,” “Medium Maturity,” and “High Maturity.” Both rating systems classify types of objectionable content into four maturity levels, and their classification rules for each level were similar but still with minor differences. For instance, apps with intense usage of offensive language are rated as “Low Maturity” (maturity level 2) on Android platform, but they are “12+” (maturity level 3) on iOS. Such inconsistency in maturity rating raises much concerns. This inconsistency issue is more challenging now with Android switched to ESRB’s 5 level maturity rating policy with “Everyone,” “Everyone 10+,” “Teen,” “Mature,” and “Adults Only” in May 2015. The inconsistency problem not only lies in policy content, but also is reflected in implementation of maturity rating policy. The main difference between iOS and Android platforms is who determines or reports the actual ratings. iOS rates each app submitted according to its own policies. The maturity ratings for Android apps are purely a result of app developers’ self-report. Developers are required to choose one from the four maturity levels before publishing their apps. After submitting to the Google Play Store, an app is available for download in just a few hours. Google does not verify each app’s maturity rating unless there are a number of user complaints. The public may raise concerns about the authenticity of the maturity ratings of Android apps, but this requires diligent policing on the part of the end user community. In contrast, iOS has a more strict review process for newly released apps. Apple first requires developers to select from a list of objectionable content and indicate the intensity of the content to generate the maturity rating. According to Apple’s “App Store Review Guidelines,” Apple examines the contents of apps and adjusts any inappropriate ratings during a review process before the app becomes available to users [7]. Due to the laxity of Android’s maturity rating policy and the lack of objective judgment of apps’ maturity levels provided by developers, many news articles have recognized the drawbacks of Android’s rating system. They claim that the Android rating policy is unclear, and it is difficult for developers to understand the difference between the four maturity-rating levels [8]. In addition, according to the Washington Post [9] and recent reports from Federal Trade Commission [10, 11], there is a rising concern among parents who have experienced that the maturity ratings of the apps are unreliable. A more critical risk resides in in-app advertisement. Many apps, especially the free ones, are connected to third party advertisements. Neither mobile platforms nor advertising networks apply these maturity policies to restrict the contents of in-app advertisements. As a result, children may still be able to view high  maturity contents from in-app advertisements within those apps rated with low maturity. For example, as a 4+ app on iOS platform, Angry Birds should “contain no objectionable materials” as shown in Figure 1. However, it allows a full-screen advertisement (Figure 2) with bloody scenes from a high maturity app appearing inside the app (the source of this bloody scene comes from the 9+ app Blood Brothers containing “Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence”). Further, Angry Birds also allows sexual banner advertisements shown on the up-right corner of the screen (Figure 3). As pointed out by the Washington Post, “there have been complaints that violent and sexual ads pop up in some apps aimed at children” [8]. Parents have noticed this issue and are concerned with the objectionable contents of in-app advertisements. However, currently there are no standard rating policy applied to advertisement content and little research investigating this problem. According to our best knowledge, little systematic research has conducted to analyze the problems with apps’ maturity rating policy and their implementation for children’s protection. Thus, the risks associated with content inappropriateness is unknown [12]. This project develops mechanisms to compare, analyze and verify the maturity ratings of mobile apps and in-app advertisements, and investigates the possible reasons behind the inaccurate ratings.","[""ios"",""android"",""video"",""google-play"",""view"",""post"",""mobile"",""scene"",""themes"",""ads"",""banner"",""app-store"",""list"",""set"",""download"",""process"",""project"",""screen"",""this"",""smartphone"",""tablet"",""select"",""types"",""state"",""in-app"",""platform"",""motion"",""review"",""store"",""policy"",""implementation"",""learning"",""google"",""advertising"",""app"",""game"",""language"",""apps"",""educational"",""ios-app"",""life"",""classification"",""android-apps"",""news"",""level"",""free"",""apple"",""games"",""movie"",""base"",""content"",""picture"",""daily"",""rating"",""verify"",""kids"",""strategy"",""survey"",""articles"",""play"",""number"",""first"",""rules"",""rate"",""generate"",""trade"",""publishing"",""risk"",""source"",""about"",""for"",""advertisement"",""video-game"",""film"",""it"",""best"",""official"",""age"",""standard"",""standards"",""board"",""with"",""in"",""research"",""complaints"",""software"",""party"",""cartoon"",""developers"",""user"",""2"",""ratings"",""order"",""public"",""levels"",""entertainment"",""blood"",""from"",""analyze"",""reports"",""corner"",""result"",""news-articles"",""the"",""help"",""as"",""important"",""should"",""access"",""based"",""usage"",""authenticity"",""similar"",""to"",""one"",""pop"",""no"",""market"",""main"",""android-rating"",""policies"",""problems"",""on"",""birds"",""its"",""parents"",""a"",""how"",""not"",""fantasy"",""8"",""mobile-apps"",""third-party"",""scenes"",""users"",""5"",""advertisements"",""only"",""issue"",""now"",""and"",""an"",""association"",""children"",""pop-up"",""full-screen"",""some"",""choose"",""able"",""adoption"",""rates"",""will"",""strict"",""offensive"",""do"",""exposure"",""10"",""objective"",""figure"",""different"",""any"",""associated"",""difference"",""high""]"

KJFrameForAndroid开发框架的设计思想是通过封装Android原生SDK中复杂的复杂操作而达到简化Android应用级开发，最终实现快速而又安全的开发APP。总共分为五大模块：UILibrary，UtilsLibrary，HttpLibrary，BitmapLibrary，DBLibrary。 优点：功能比较全面，代码效率很高，文档完善，有项目demo，出来的比较晚借鉴了很多大型框架经验。 缺点：项目文档是html页面，查看起来很不方便，项目交流平台没多少人说话（难道大神都是不说话的？） （这两个评价是KJFrameForAndroid的作者对自己的评价，个人觉得作者是个天才。他的评价可能刚写完网上发布后写的。我在给他更新评价。因为现在已经过去了几个月一直在时不时更新。功能很全，项目文档也很全面，而且代码里注释最多 这方面这个很难得。交流平台人很多挺热闹，作者希望更热闹这样框架越来越完善。对于初学者希望看到Demo更完善） 8、  dhroid 官方介绍： dhroid 是基于android 平台, 极速开发框架，其核心设计目标是开发迅速、代码量少、学习简单、功能强大、轻量级、易扩展.使你更快,更好的开发商业级别应用 开源地址: http://git.oschina.net/tengzhinei/dhroid 功能： 1.Ioc容器: (用过spring的都知道)视图注入,对象注入,接口注入,解决类依赖关系 2.Eventbus:

The project also has a login page where in the user is required to register and only then can view the availability of blood and may also register to donate blood if he/she wishes to. This project requires internet access and thus there is a disadvantage of internet failure. Thus this application helps to select the right donor online instantly using medical details along with the blood group. The main aim of developing this application is to reduce the time to a great extent that is spent in searching for the right donor and the availability of blood required.

"Ram15144/Guess_Game_Android_Studio","A strategy game called Guess Four in which each of two players sets up a secret sequence of four decimal digits. The two players take turns guessing the sequence of digits of their opponent. A player responds to an opponents guess by specifying the number of digits that were successfully guessed in the correct position and the number of digits that were successfully guessed but in the wrong positions. Thus, if a players chosen number is 2017 and the opponent guesses 1089, the opponent would be told that one digit was guessed correctly in the correct position (i.e., the 0), and another digit was guessed in the wrong position, (i.e., the 1). The implementation involves two background threads that play against each other while also updating the user interface with their moves. The first thread to correctly guess the opposing thread’s number wins the game. The UI thread is responsible for creating and starting the two worker threads and for maintaining and updating the display. Each worker thread will take turns taking the following actions: 1. Waiting for a short time (1-2 seconds) in order for a human viewer to take note of the previous move on the display. 2. Figuring out the next guess of this thread. 3. Communicating this guess to the opponent thread. 4. Waiting for a response from the opponent thread. 5. Communicating both the guess and the response from the opposite thread to the UI thread. While carrying out the above steps each worker thread is able to respond to guesses from the opponent thread. Whenever a guess from the opponent thread is received, a worker thread responds by communicating the number of correctly positioned and incorrectly positioned digits contained in the guess to the opponent thread. Furthermore, the game must proceeds in lockstep between the two threads. A thread is not allowed to make two consecutive guesses without handling an intervening guess from the opponent thread. The UI thread is specifically responsible for the following functionality: 1. Showing the two initial numbers chosen by the worker threads. 2. Receiving notifications of guesses and their outcomes by the worker threads. 3. Displaying the guesses and responses of each worker thread in an appropriate format as each worker thread communicates this information to the UI thead.  4. Displaying a button to start the game. Pressing this button while a game is in progress will void the current game and start a new game from scratch. 5. Checking on the status of the game, by determining whether one thread has won or the game needs to continue. 6. Halting the game after each thread has made 20 guesses without identifying the opponent’s number. 7. Signaling the two worker threads that the game is over; the two threads stops their execution as a result of this action. Displaying the outcome of the game in the UI.  Implementation: 1. Handlers are used to implement the communication between the three threads involved. Each thread has a handler, a job queue and a looper. 2. Both runnables and messages are included in the job queue of the worker threads. 3. The two worker threads uses different strategies for winning the game. 4. The game is played at such a speed that a human user can clearly see and understand the move of each thread. 5. The app’s display has two layouts or fragments, one for each worker thread, lying side-by-side and occupying the entire screen width. Each side displays the secret number of the corresponding thread at the top and a scrollable list of the thread’s guesses and the opponent thread’s responses in the remainder of the vertical space. 7. The two worker threads will use a random number generator to create their secret number. These numbers are communicated to the UI thread, which will immediately display both numbers.
