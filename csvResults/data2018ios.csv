"elliottjm/ZBarQR","Read Me About ZBarQR(for 64 bit)  ZBar bar code reader  ZBar is an open source software suite for reading bar codes from various sources, such as video streams, image files and raw intensity sensors. It supports many popular symbologies (types of bar codes) including EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.  The flexible, layered implementation facilitates bar code scanning and decoding for any application: use it stand-alone with the included GUI and command line programs, easily integrate a bar code scanning widget into your Qt, GTK+ or PyGTK GUI application, leverage one of the script or programming interfaces (Python, Perl, C++) ...all the way down to a streamlined C library suitable for embedded use.  ZBar is licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1 to enable development of both open source and commercial projects.  If you want to get more, please visit http://zbar.sourceforge.net/index.html  How to use ZBar for QR code reader ?  Here for download : https://sourceforge.net/projects/zbar/files/iPhoneSDK/beta/ Here for get API : http://zbar.sourceforge.net/iphone/sdkdoc/tutorial.html  Nessary frameworks  AVFoundation.framework CoreMedia.framework CoreVideo.framework QuartzCore.framework libiconv.dylib(<iOS 9) libiconv.tbd(>iOS 9)  What this sample solve ?  We know the latest ZBarSDK version is '1.3.1' (2012). which is not support for arm64 iOS devices. Since I recompiled the SDK for both simulators and iOS device in arm64, we can keep on developing using ZBarSDK.  For Chinese users, ZBarSDK cannot read QR Code generating by Chinese sometimes. So I recompiled the encoding with GB18030 to solve this embarassment.  Copy the 'libzbar.a' into your project to start QR code work!!  How to generate QR code ?  In this sample, we use ""libqrencode"".(Something about libqrencode, please Google online)  Credits and Version History  If you find any problems with this sample, please file a bug against it.  <Email : 1085952007@qq.com>  1.0 (Nov 2015) was the first shipping version. 1.1 (Jan 2016) added custom view for scanning QR code. 1.2 (May 2016) added custom popView. 1.3 (Jun 2016) use CocoaPods 1.0.1.

"sonali-developer/playingCards","Game Description: A game that draws random number of cards from the deck of 52 designed playing cards and displays them on the game interface, all of which performs a speedy random movement affected by gravity. During this motion, the player needs to select two cards with same face, rank and color with concentration by flipping the moving cards upon touching them. In case of mismatch, both the cards will be flipped back to the original appearance, whereas they will get removed if matched. It is an interesting game developed by implementing complex utilities of iOS application development.  • Developed for both iOS and iPad platforms of different sizes in both landscape and portrait mode using Xcode 9 and Swift 4. • Utilized frameworks like Foundation, UIKit & CoreMotion. • Followed Object Oriented and MVC Design Pattern.  • Demonstrated the utility of following features in addition to core app development:  Custom UIView creation in code,  Gesture handling,  UIView hierarchy,  Drawing with Core Graphics and UIBezierPath,  IBDesignable & IBInspectable, UIDynamicAnimator,  Timer,  UIView transition,  Behaviors like UICollisonBehavior, UIPushBehavior, UIGravityBehavior, UIDynamicItemBehavior, etc. Memory Cycle Avoidance, and so on.","[""swift"",""xcode"",""ios"",""uiview"",""random"",""graphics"",""memory"",""get"",""core-graphics"",""frameworks"",""uikit"",""ipad"",""drawing"",""object"",""gesture"",""landscape"",""this"",""back"",""ibdesignable"",""select"",""portrait"",""player"",""app"",""game"",""custom"",""behaviors"",""color"",""design"",""application"",""utility"",""utilities"",""core"",""object-oriented"",""mvc"",""cards"",""cycle"",""number"",""so"",""for"",""movement"",""it"",""with"",""in"",""like"",""features"",""original"",""from"",""the"",""complex"",""portrait-mode"",""following"",""to"",""ios-application"",""on"",""using"",""a"",""deck"",""needs"",""interesting"",""and"",""an"",""removed"",""mode"",""will"",""custom-uiview"",""sizes"",""concentration"",""different"",""will-get"",""two""]"

"hadanischal/PublisherFacts","iOS Proficiency Exercise (Banking) Overview The purpose of this exercise is to assess candidate developer’s iOS coding knowledge and style. The exercise involves build a “proof of concept” app which consumes a REST service and displays photos with headings and descriptions. The exercise will be evaluated on coding style, understanding of programming concepts, choice of techniques, and also by the developer’s process, as indicated by the trail of git commits.        Specification       Create a universal iOS app which: 1. Ingests a json feed from   https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2iodh4vg0eortkl/facts.json   2. You can use a third party json parser to parse this if desired.   3. The feed contains a title and a list of rows   4. Use Collection View to display the content. Making sure the CollectionViewCell size is dynamic and which should vary based on the image size.          5. Restrict the image to go to outside of the device width if image is having a larger width then your device. 6. Loads the images lazily   7. Don’t download them all at once, but only as needed 8. Refresh function 9. Each image having title at the bottom of the image. 10. For iphone & iPad (portrait)- When click on collection view image, navigate to detail page having title on navigation bar with image as banner and description at the bottom of the banner image. 11. For iphone & iPad (landscape)- When click on collection view image, navigate to detail page having title on navigation bar with image on the left hand side of the screen and description at the right hand side of the screen (ratio size of the screen between image and description is 30:70).      Note - Should not block UI when loading the data from the json feed.           Guidelines        1. Use Git to manage the source code. A clear Git history showing your process is required.   2. Scrolling the collection view should be smooth, even as images are downloading and getting added to the cells.   3. App should support both iPhone and iPad (in both orientations).   4. If threading is considered - Do no spawn threads manually by using performSelectorOnBackgroundThread, use GCD queues instead. 5. Use auto layout while designing the screen. 6. Comment your code where necessary.   7. Try to polish your code and the apps functionality as much as possible.   8. Commit your changes to git in small chunks with meaningful comments   9. Do not use any singletons in your submission        Additional Requirements 1.
