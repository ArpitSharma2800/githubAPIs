"jojojojochen/OfflineBling_AndroidApp","OfflineBling offers refugees offline access to Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha without the need of a data connection (WiFi or data). Using multiple APIs, including Twilio, MediaWiki, and Wolfram Alpha API, users can search Wikipedia or query Wolfram Alpha without having to connect to the Internet. The process is done through SMSes with Twilio, which is integrated into our app, and basically provides free offline Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha searching if you have unlimited texting on your phone plan. In addition to this, we have built a community Q&A system where users can ask questions through a text message and receive an answer if that question has been answered before. If not, the question is added to the database for other members of the refugee community to answer.  Going forward, improvements could be made on the accuracy of the searching. As well, we could group similar questions in the Q&A system together to avoid too many identical questions popping up. And the design could always use a few more tweaks.","[""text"",""offline"",""database"",""search"",""process"",""connection"",""message"",""alpha"",""connect"",""system"",""design"",""wikipedia"",""phone"",""wolfram-alpha"",""free"",""data"",""community"",""group"",""accuracy"",""query"",""multiple"",""for"",""can"",""with"",""in"",""receive"",""the"",""refugees"",""as"",""access"",""questions"",""similar"",""to"",""avoid"",""wolfram"",""on"",""using"",""a"",""answer"",""searching"",""users"",""and"",""made"",""an"",""without"",""together"",""other"",""question"",""texting""]"

As with most complex forms layouts, the biggest challenge is responding to orientation changes.   This popup class takes care of all that for you.  It even responds to relative popups within a Scroll View.  The popup arrow will stay relative to the control that launched it.  It will also adjust and reposition itself relative to its position within a scroll.  The main methods are ShowPopupRelative, ShowPopupByMargin and ShowPopupCenter.  Since it is a class you can easily tweak the display to your specific requirements.

"AdamWilfred/How-to-create-an-interactive-ebook","I'd like to share my experience of using a free software to create ebooks, and describe the steps I followed to achieve that. One of the great things about this software is the ability to add interactive objects inside your ebook. Although it's a free software, no ads appear in your ebook, and you can actually replace the Kotobee logo with your own! The software I'm using to create ebooks is called Kotobee Author. Hope you enjoy this tutorial.  [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/author.gif[/IMG]  [B]How to create an interactive ebook[/B]  Download [URL=""https://www.kotobee.com/""]Kotobee Author[/URL] from their website's [URL=""https://www.kotobee.com/pricing""]Downloads & Pricing[/URL] page here: [URL=""www.kotobee.com/pricing""]www.kotobee.com/pricing[/URL]. Choose your operating system: Windows 32-bit, 64-bit, or Mac OS. The download will start immediately.  [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-a.jpg[/IMG]   Run the installer and follow the instructions as needed.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-b.jpg[/IMG]   To start creating ebooks, open [URL=""https://www.kotobee.com/""]Kotobee Autho[/URL]r. Note it may take a while to open at the first run. You will see an editor similar to Microsoft Word where you can start writing the content of your book, using standard text formatting tools.  [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-1.jpg[/IMG]   There is an initial chapter created for you by default but you can add more chapters anytime. You can also add subchapters to any chapter by clicking on the + button next to it.  [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-2.jpg[/IMG]  Once you've entered a substantial amount of text, it's time to add some images. Drag and drop images into the editor, or add them using the Image tool from the toolbox on the right. A popup will appear giving you several options to choose from (i.e. dimensions, text-wrapping, etc).  [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-3.jpg[/IMG]   I won't go into all the details, but I'd like to particularly mention the animation options. Below the Animation on click label, you will be able to choose the kind of animation that happens once the user clicks on the image. You can make the image wiggle, jump, or scale in and out. You can also make the image open in a popup window once clicked. Simple to create, and appealing to the user.  Since you're working inside the editor, interactive components won't display their interaction. You need to go into preview mode to do that. Click on Preview Mode at the bottom right.  Post title: How to create an interactive ebook User name: Adam  Forum categories:  Forums related to ebooks, digital publishing, education technology.   The forums should equally fall within all categories   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-4.jpg[/IMG]   Click on the image and see the image animating as you specified.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-15.jpg[/IMG]   As another example, let's add a YouTube video. Click on the Video tool button. Paste the URL of the YouTube video, and click on Create. It's as simple as that! Enter preview mode to see the video in action.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-6.jpg[/IMG]   One of the impressive things worth looking into are ebook widgets. They are like mini-apps you put inside your ebook, that open in a popup once clicked by your users. There are like thousands of widgets available online for download (free and commercial). Two popular widget providers I like are www.bookry.com and www.bookwidgets.com. Sign up for a free account, and download any of their free widgets.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/bookry.png[/IMG]   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/bookwidgets.png[/IMG]   The widget file is basically a zip file format. Click on the Widget tool button and browse to the widget file. Enter preview mode again, and check out the widget in action. This is an example of a calculator widget:   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-7.jpg[/IMG]   Now that the ebook has enough content, it's time to export it. But before doing that, let's customize the interface, and choose the components we'd like available in the ebook. Click on the Customize tab at the top. From the left panel, you have many design options to choose from. You can add your own logo, startup image, header colors, and endless other options.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-8.jpg[/IMG]   You can also choose the components you'd like in your ebook, such as search, google lookup, text-to-speech, and others. You can also specify the default language for the interface.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-9.jpg[/IMG]   Now's a good time to preview your entire ebook. You can preview it on different devices (e.g. iPad, iPhone, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Nexus, etc). The different devices are available from the Platform list. Click on the Components tab.  Now to publish your ebook. Click the Export tab. You'll find a list of different export formats that are supported, such as web apps (HTML5), desktop apps (Windows and Mac), Android apps, iOS apps (iPad & iPhone), LMS SCORM components, etc.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-10.jpg[/IMG]   I'm assuming that you're interested in publishing a web app of your ebook, and hosting it on a server via FTP. Click on Export Web Applications, and then on Enter serial number... The login dialog box will appear.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-11.jpg[/IMG]   Click on Register a free serial number. You will be required to fill a registration form. A free serial number will be emailed to you. Simply enter it into the same dialog box, and you will be able to export the Web app.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-13.jpg[/IMG]   Select the destination folder to save the files. If you enter the folder, you will find that they contain various HTML, JS, and CSS files.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-14.jpg[/IMG]   Upload these files to your server and simply enter the URL in the browser to see your ebook in action.   [IMG]https://www.kotobee.com/img/media/tutorials/basic/create-ebook-12.jpg[/IMG]   [B]Hope you found that easy![/B]   There's an online user guide available for Kotobee Author that can guide you step by step: http://support.kotobee.com.

"Ash-ik/KhudeBarta","KhudeBarta is an android app to send compressed bangla SMS. Each SMS can send 1120 bits for the cost of one SMS. As bangla is unicode, it holds 16 bits per character.

Also includes (2) K-type thermocouple inputs for Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) and Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT) monitoring. The goal is to provide a programmable ignition controller that dynamically adjusts based on EGT and CHT values.  A Windows program allows you to customize ignition curves over USB; log RPM, CHT, and EGT values; and flash the firmware. You can save maps, read the map that is loaded,etc. I've also created an basic android app that displays the RPM, CHT, and EGT values. In addition, the FF mini simulates the popular OBDII ELM327 interface. This allows my old Vespa to have an ""OBD II ecu"", allowing you to take advantage of the many ELM327 based apps available.

"tobyli/Sugilite_development","SUGILITE is a new programming-by-demonstration (PBD) system that enables users to create automation on smartphones. SUGILITE uses Android’s accessibility API to support automating arbitrary tasks in any Android app (or even across multiple apps). When the user gives verbal commands that SUGILITE does not know how to execute, the user can demonstrate by directly manipulating the regular apps’ user interface. By leveraging the verbal instructions, the demonstrated procedures, and the apps’ UI hierarchy structures, SUGILITE can automatically generalize the script from the recorded actions, so SUGILITE learns how to perform tasks with different variations and parameters from a single demonstration. Extensive error handling and context checking support forking the script when new situations are encountered, and provide robustness if the apps change their user interface. Our lab study suggests that users with little or no programming knowledge can successfully automate smartphone tasks using SUGILITE.","[""android"",""api"",""parameters"",""error-handling"",""automation"",""smartphone"",""accessibility"",""system"",""android-app"",""ui"",""app"",""script"",""apps"",""study"",""programming"",""new"",""knowledge"",""context"",""so"",""multiple"",""change"",""tasks"",""can"",""with"",""in"",""user"",""error"",""support"",""hierarchy"",""from"",""automatically"",""lab"",""single"",""the"",""know-how"",""commands"",""to"",""no"",""on"",""using"",""a"",""how"",""not"",""how-to"",""users"",""checking"",""create"",""and"",""robustness"",""handling"",""different"",""any""]"

"ShamariFeaster/posada","It's called POSADA (personal open source automated digital assistant). It's a open source digital assistant. The primary use cases are financial (paying bills, transferring money, etc). It will open source and user hosted. People host their assistant on pre-loaded, plug and play raspberry pi 3s. Hopefully there will be a community of developers that will share integrations (ie, scraping scripts). So if I want my assistant to work with my local bank, I build an intergration and now anyone else that has the same bank can connect to it. POSADA's logic will be programmable as well. So you can customize when it alerts you, requests confirmation, or automatically transfers money from one account to another to pay a bill. One of the use cases I'm most excited about is the ability of POSADA to make donations to organization and charities you care about. So rather than setting up an auto-pay thing with a 3rd party, you tell POSADA how much you want to give, how frequently, and can even adjust the amount based on an assessment of your current financial position. The user would be in total control and I hope that will encourage more people to financial support media outlets, open source projects, and other worthy causes on a regular, sustaining basis. I've got a mobile app prototype that handles two factor authentication and will eventually grow to become the front end of the assistant. I'm currently leveraging the built in speech-to-text capabilities of android phone to allow the user to communicate with their assistant via voice.","[""android"",""authentication"",""mobile"",""share"",""build"",""local"",""open-source"",""media"",""logic"",""raspberry-pi"",""host"",""connect"",""account"",""app"",""mobile-app"",""phone"",""integrations"",""assistant"",""prototype"",""community"",""android-phone"",""requests"",""customize"",""speech-to-text"",""money"",""play"",""so"",""control"",""bank"",""open"",""source"",""setting"",""about"",""alerts"",""excited"",""pi"",""two-factor-authentication"",""two-factor"",""digital"",""can"",""raspberry"",""it"",""thing"",""assessment"",""with"",""in"",""scraping"",""developers"",""user"",""support"",""transfers"",""from"",""front-end"",""automatically"",""adjust"",""care"",""the"",""as"",""organization"",""based"",""make"",""work"",""to"",""one"",""current"",""pay"",""got"",""on"",""a"",""donations"",""how"",""financial"",""now"",""and"",""an"",""will"",""automated"",""share-integrations"",""allow"",""plug"",""i"",""other"",""two"",""factor""]"

Therefore we intend to aid in the bus arrival intimation by bringing in an application that will help in successfully tracking the school bus and the child. This application uses RFID and GPS based Android Phone where the tracker is used for locating the current geographic position of the bus and RFID(Radio Frequency Identification Device) is used to uniquely identify every child. This application can also be used to inform the parents whether their child has boarded the school bus as well as arrival at school. GPS based Android Phone will be used by parents to enter the bus number in which their child travels. Parents can also enter the source and the user will get detailed information about the location of the bus. This system uses a database on backend to store the relevant information about the bus and the child which is used to update the application.","[""android"",""get"",""position"",""database"",""gps"",""location"",""backend"",""rfid"",""this"",""wait"",""tracking"",""system"",""store"",""frequency"",""update"",""application"",""tracker"",""phone"",""information"",""bus"",""android-phone"",""school"",""students"",""number"",""source"",""about"",""for"",""can"",""it"",""in"",""user"",""buses"",""the"",""help"",""as"",""based"",""hire"",""to"",""current"",""on"",""parents"",""a"",""reach"",""child"",""identification"",""issue"",""and"",""an"",""will"",""mainstream"",""geographic"",""will-get"",""arrival""]"

"CityPulse/Brasov-Bus-Route-Planner","In order to demonstrate how the CityPulse framework can be used to develop applications for smart cities and citizens, we have implemented a context-aware real time Travel Planner using the live data from the city of Brasov, Romania. This scenario aims to provide bus travel-planning solutions, which go beyond the state of the art solutions by allowing users to provide multi dimensional requirements and preferences such as the fastest route, number of buses, minimum number of stops as well as busses with special facilities for people with disabilities. In this way the users receive bus route recommendations based on the current context of the city. In addition to this, Travel Planner continuously monitors the user context and events detected on the planned route. User will be prompted to opt for a different route if there are reported incidents ahead. All the CityPulse framework components are deployed on a back-end server and are accessible via a set of APIs. As a result of that the application developer has only to develop a user-friendly front-end application, which calls the framework APIs. In our case we have developed an Android application.","[""android"",""server"",""set"",""preferences"",""time"",""events"",""this"",""real-time"",""state"",""components"",""go"",""framework"",""application"",""travel"",""bus"",""city"",""data"",""art"",""live"",""route"",""number"",""context"",""smart"",""opt"",""for"",""planner"",""can"",""cities"",""with"",""in"",""calls"",""user"",""developer"",""order"",""multi"",""accessible"",""from"",""front-end"",""result"",""receive"",""the"",""as"",""back-end"",""requirements"",""based"",""to"",""current"",""applications"",""develop"",""on"",""using"",""live-data"",""a"",""how"",""scenario"",""solutions"",""users"",""fastest"",""travel-planner"",""only"",""and"",""an"",""will"",""monitors"",""context-aware"",""real"",""recommendations"",""different""]"

When the employee crosses particular boundary area an immediate alert message will be sent to the manager’s mobile phone. Employee monitoring system using android mobile is, essentially, software that allows Managers to monitor their Employee's office cell phone. All incoming and outgoing calls, texts and multimedia messages can be seen and interrupted by the Managers, who can also monitor where their Employee are (through GPS), access a history of where they've been and set up alerts if their Employee are going outside of approved geographical zones, are receiving texts from unapproved numbers or calls from banned persons. For convenience, the alerts are also stored in the centralized server like the details of incoming call, text and multimedia messages and the timely location update of their Employee. Managers may later login into the centralized server and view the details of their Employee's mobile usage. This system is really very helpful for the Managers to monitor their Employee through mobile phones.
